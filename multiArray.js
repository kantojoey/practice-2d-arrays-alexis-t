// Challenge 1: Student Scores
// You need to organize scores for three students, each of whom has taken three
// tests. Create a 2D array named allScores where each inner array contains three
// test scores for a single student.
// 1. Write the code to create the allScores array with three inner arrays.
// 2. Each inner array should contain three numeric scores of your choice.
let allScores = [
    [97, 95, 95],
    [93, 87, 79],
    [85, 82, 89]
];
// console.log(allScores);

// Challenge 2: Build a Seating Grid
// You want to model three rows of seats in a theater with four seats per row. Create
// a 2D array called theaterSeating that has an outer array of three inner arrays,
// each inner array representing a row of four seat labels. (For instance, seat labels
// could be "A1", "A2", etc.)
// 1. Use nested array literals to define the structure.
// 2. Ensure each inner array has exactly four seat labels.
let theaterSeating = [
    ["A21", "A22", "A23", "A24"],
    ["B21", "B22", "B23", "B24"],
    ["C21", "C22", "C23", "C24"]
];
// console.log(theaterSeating);

// Challenge 3: Form a Multi-Dimensional Contact List
// Create a 2D array named contactsList where each inner array represents one
// contact’s info. For now, store three pieces of information in each inner array, such
// as ["Name", "Email", "Phone"]. Create two of these inner arrays in
// contactsList.
// 1. Define the outer array contactsList.
// 2. Insert two inner arrays, each with three strings representing a contact’s
// details.

let contactsList = [
    ["Coco Gauff", "callmecoco@yahoo.com", "561-293-8291"],
    ["Roger Rabbit", "richrabbit33@gmail.com", "314-123-4567"]
];
// console.log(contactsList);
